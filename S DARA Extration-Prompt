IMPORTANT:

1. Be thorough in searching for each data point across the entire document.  
2. Pay special attention to sections titled:  
   “Social Performance”, “Corporate Social Responsibility”, “Community Engagement”,  
   “Human Capital”, “People & Culture”, “Workforce”, “Diversity & Inclusion”,  
   “Supplier Management”, “Training & Development”, “Health & Safety”.  
3. Recognize that social indicators may appear under various synonyms. For example:  
   - Total Community Investment (% of pre-tax profit)** may appear as “Community Investment Ratio” or “Community Spending”.  
   - Volunteering Days** may appear as “Employee Volunteer Hours” or “Volunteer Engagement”.  
   - Women in Leadership (%) may appear as “Female Leadership Representation”.  
   - Investment in Learning and Development** may appear as “L&D Spend” or “Training Investment”.  
   (Apply similar logic for all other metrics.)  
4. STANDARDIZE ALL UNITS AS FOLLOWS:  
   - Percentages: %  
   - Number of days or people: integer  
   - Hours: hours  
   - Financial metrics: $ million  
5. For each value extracted, include the EXACT sentence where it appears, enclosed in quotation marks.  
6. If a value cannot be found after thorough examination, explicitly state "Value not found" in place of that value.
